- Show, not tell; concrete images over abstractions.
- Keep grammar simple; prefer present tense unless viewpoint overrides.
- One frame only; no new metaphors after the **settle** beat.
- Prefer low camera, soft sound cues (e.g., hush); no slapstick or neon metaphors.
- Bilingual: Persian words only when semantically necessary, never decorative.
- Respect **one-move** if shot planning is enabled.
